# PARTAY
I was hired by the IHRPS (International Human Resources Professionals Society) to help plan a party for HR professionals from up to 16 different companies. This program was designed to take 2 files (one that gives info about individual people and one that gives info about companies that the individuals work for) and analyze them so that individuals would be split up into different tables, with no more than one representative from each company at a table. You can view these arrangements either by table or by company, and if you are searching for a specific person, there is a functionality to locate a person and view information about them such as what table and seat they sit at. 





The IHRPS still hasn't payed me.
